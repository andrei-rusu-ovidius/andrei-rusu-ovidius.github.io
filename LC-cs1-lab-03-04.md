## Logica matematică și computațională

### Specializarea: 

* Informatică, seria 1, anul 1; 
* Computer Science, anul 1.

### Profesor:

* lect. dr. Andrei Rusu

## Obiective:
* To build the minimal normal forms for the formulas of the clasic propositional calculus. 
* To design and to implement the algorithm for obtaining minimal normal forms for propositional formulas.

## Conditions for solving the laboratory tasks

1. If the formula `F` is a tautology then consider its conjunction with the formula `((A -> B) v (B ~ C) v (C -> D))`. 
2. If the formula `F` is a contradiction then consider its disjunction with the formula `((A -> B) v (B ~ C) v (C -> D))`. 

2. If the formula `F` contains less than 4 distinct propositional variables, then consider its conjunction with the formula `((A -> B) v (B ~ C) v (C -> D))`.

4. Every student work at the formula from the **[list](./LC_Lab_01_Lista_formule.html)**  in accordance with the variant given by its number in the list of students:
   * [Computer Science](./cs1.html),
   * [Informatică](./info1s1.html). 
5. Any programming language can be used, for example, **C, C++, Java, Prolog, Lisp, Python, PHP,** etc.
6. Any program should state clearly:
   - initial conditions,
   - which is the result,
   - important intermediary results on the way to the main results. 

## Tasks:

a. Build the truth table of the formula `F`. (1p)
b. Build the conjunctive normal form  as well as the disjunctive normal form of the formula `F`. (2p)
c. Build the minimal disjunctive normal form of `F`. (2p)
d. Build the minimal conjunctive normal form of `F`. (2p)
d. Design and program the algorithms for above mentioned tasks. (rest of the points -:) )
