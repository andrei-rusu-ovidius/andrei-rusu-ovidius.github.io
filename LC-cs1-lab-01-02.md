# Laboratory activity 01-02

---

## Mathematical an Compuational Logic

### Speciality: 

* Informatică, seria 1, anul 1; 
* Computer Science, anul 1.

### Teacher:

* lect. dr. Andrei Rusu


## Conditions for solving the laboratory

a. Each solved task of the laboratory and the whole laboratory should be submitted personally to the teacher; after the done work must be submitted to the email: andrei-rusu.ovidius@gmail.com. For each 2 weeks of delay in submitting the work will lead to possible decrease of points (usualy by 1 point). 
b. Every student works with the formula from the list  **[list](./LC_Lab_01_Lista_formule.html)** in accordance with the variant indicated in one of the lists:
   * [Computer Science](./cs1.html),
   * [Informatică](./info1s1.html). 
c. Any programming language can be used, for example, **C, C++, Java, Prolog, Lisp, Python, PHP,** etc. 

## Tasks:

a. Determine the number of subformulas of the given formula  (consider formula as a string). (1p)
b. Determine the number of distinct propositional variables  in the formula. (1p)
c. Determine the number of occurences for each propositional variable in the formula. (1p)
d. Determine the order of the formula (its logical length = number of logical conectives) (1p)
e. Build the truth table of the formula. (2p)
f. The corresponding programs should be used this a minimal effort to answer similar questions for other formulas. Document the documents. (8p)
