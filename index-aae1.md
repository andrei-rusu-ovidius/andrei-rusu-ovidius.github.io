### ** Course **: Applied mathematics in economics

### ** Speciality **:  Business Administration, 1st year

#### Prof .: Lect. dr. Andrei RUSU

---

### Goals:

1. To know mathematical technics used in the study of economics and business. 
2. To build mathematical models for different problems of economics and business. 
3. To solve using mathematics different problems from economics and business. 

### Requirements for Admission to the Colloquium (Exam):

1. Performing laboratory/seminar work, teaching and supporting it on time (at least 1 work must be taught and sustained).
2. Presence at the colloquium (exam) at the scheduled day and time.

### The final grade is calculated according to the algorithm:

1. Mark on the examination paper (colloquium) - 100%,
   a. Grid test - 50%,
   b. Solving problems from a list of problems (usually 2 out of 4 problems) - 50%,
3. Bonus (for activity in course and laboratory/seminar activities): - maximum 10%.
