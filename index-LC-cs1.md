### We are also online: 
- Webex: https://meetingsemea5.webex.com/meet/andrei.rusu
- Discord: https://discord.gg/UbyF7ZvVw3
- Teams: 
- Moodle: https://moodle.univ-ovidius.ro/course/view.php?id=2178


### Goals:

1. Working with the objects used in the proposititional  logic.
2. Approach exercises using imperative and declarative programming languages. 
3. Implementation of the algorithms discussed in the courses.

### Requirements for Admission to the Colloquium (Exam):

1. Performing laboratory work, teaching and supporting it on time (at least 1 work must be taught and sustained).
2. Presence at the colloquium (exam) at the scheduled day and time.

### The final grade is calculated according to the algorithm:

1. Mark on the examination paper (colloquium) - 50%,
   a. Grid test - 50%,
   b. Solving problems from a list of problems (usually 2 out of 4 problems) - 50%,
2. Mark for laboratory activity - 50%
   a. Written paper: - Not more than 10%
   b. Design, teaching and support in reasonable time of laboratory work - at least 80%,
   c. Laboratory activity - at most 10%,
3. Bonus (for activity in course and laboratory activities + attendance): - maximum 10%.

#### Note:

as programming language, you can use C, C ++, Java, unless it is explicitly stated that Prolog is used as the programming language. A short introduction to Java can be found here (Part 1, Part 2, ...). You can also find a multitude of tutorials for C and C ++.
