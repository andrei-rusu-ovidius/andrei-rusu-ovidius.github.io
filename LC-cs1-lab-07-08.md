## Mathematical and Computational Logic

### Speciality: 

* Informatică, seria 1, anul 1; 
* Computer Science, anul 1.

### Teacher:

* lect. dr. Andrei Rusu

## Goals:
* To build different models for different signatures of the first-order logic. 

## Conditions for solving the laboratory tasks
<!--
1. If the formula `F` is a tautology then consider its conjunction with the formula `((A -> B) v (B ~ C) v (C -> D))`. 
2. If the formula `F` is a contradiction then consider its disjunction with the formula `((A -> B) v (B ~ C) v (C -> D))`. 

2. If the formula `F` contains less than 4 distinct propositional variables, then consider its conjunction with the formula `((A -> B) v (B ~ C) v (C -> D))`.

4. Every student work at the formula from the **[list](./LC_Lab_01_Lista_formule.html)**  in accordance with the variant given by its number in the list of students:
   * [Computer Science](./cs1.html),
   * [Informatică](./info1s1.html). 
5. Any programming language can be used, for example, **C, C++, Java, Prolog, Lisp, Python, PHP,** etc.
6. Any program should state clearly:
   - initial conditions,
   - which is the result,
   - important intermediary results on the way to the main results. 
-->

- It is sufficient to solve the tasks on paper and to present them in time to the teacher. 
- The **[individual variant](./LC_Lab-07-08-lista-variante.html)** for each student is in accordance to the list (as at previous laboratory works):
   * [Computer Science](./cs1.html),
   * [Informatică](./info1s1.html). 
- Individual variants should be considered from the **[list](./LC_Lab-07-08-lista-variante.html)**.

## Tasks:

Consider an alphabet of the predicate calculus, for wich we have a list of  propositional constants `Const`, a list of function symbols `Func`, and a list of predicate symbols `Pred`. 

a. Build models / interpretations `I` for this predicate calculus, 
b. Give examples of corresponding formulas (and the corresponding justifications) that: 
   - are valid at the interpretation `I`, 
   - are contradictions at the interpretation `I`, 
   - are valid for some evaluations `v1` based on interpretation `I` and at the same time are invalid for other evaluations `v2` based on the same interpretation `I`. These formulas should contain all symbols from `Const`, `Func`, and `Pred`.
